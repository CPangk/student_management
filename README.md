This is a Student Management System built with ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core (SQL Server), and JWT authentication. Admins can manage students, courses, and enrollments (including grades), while students can log in to view their info and grades. The project uses role-based authentication with ASP.NET Identity and comes with a seeded admin account (admin@example.com)/Admin@12345 be sure to change this!!!!). To run it locally, update your appsettings.json connection string, run dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -o Data/Migrations, dotnet ef database update, and then dotnet run to start the API. Once running, you can head to https://localhost:5001/swagger to explore the RESTful endpoints.
